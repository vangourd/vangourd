Hello,

My name is brianjlogan. You can also visit me at [my website](https://brianjlogan.com). 
I plan to have more activity as my development skills increase but don't believe GitHub should be spammed when a local development folder is perfectly sufficient for pet projects.
That being said I'm far from perfect and you might find some of my projects superfluous. I primarily use GitHub to look at package code and to troubleshoot issues or to serve
as better documentation than what is provided with the software. 

I primarily use Python although I have dabbled with JS, TypeScript, VueJS, Golang, read too many Bash scripts, envy the pragmatism of the Powershell project (Linux admin), and 
have trait of having approximate knowledge of many technologies. I've been doing this thing for 10 years and my first computer was a Windows 95 manilla shell desktop with Earthlink
DSL. 

I hope my code is of some use or interest to you. It was nice talking to you.
